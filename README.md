## Overview
The repository explores the use of the KNN algorithm in two distinct datasets:
- Zoo Dataset: Classifies animals into one of the seven zoo categories based on their traits.
- Glass Dataset: Predicts the type of glass based on the refractive index and other chemical properties.

## Repository Structure

- src/: Contains the Python scripts for the KNN models.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks that explore the data and initial modeling steps.
 
## Data Description
Zoo Data: Includes attributes like hair, feathers, eggs, and so on for classifying animals.
Glass Data: Contains attributes like refractive index, sodium, magnesium, etc., for glass classification.

## Models
The repository includes:
- KNN Classifier: For both datasets, with hyperparameters optimized using grid search.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
